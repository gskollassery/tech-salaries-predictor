# Tech Salaries Predictor

A data science project focused on cleaning, analyzing, and building a predictive model for technology job salaries. This project involved handling a large, messy dataset and successfully building a linear regression model with strong performance metrics.

## 🚀 Key Achievements
- **Cleaned and preprocessed** 10,000+ records, resolving missing values and outliers.
- **Achieved an R² score of 0.82** using a Linear Regression model to predict base pay.
- **Ensured prediction error within ±5.3%** at a 95% confidence level via confidence interval analysis.

## 📊 Dataset
The analysis is based on the "Salaries in Data Science" dataset from Kaggle.
**Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilbhathi/data-science-salaries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilbhathi/data-science-salaries) (You must download this file and place it in the `data` folder to run the code).

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tech-salaries-predictor.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tech-salaries-predictor`
3. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook tech_salaries_analysis.ipynb`

## 📈 Results Summary
The final model can explain 82% of the variance in salary data. Predictions are reliable, with 95% of predictions falling within 5.3% of the actual value for the test set.
